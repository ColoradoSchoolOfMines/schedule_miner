<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

   <dt>Why create the Schedule Miner?</dt>
   <dd>It all started during CSM 101 when it came time to create schedules for
   the spring term. My CSM 101 advisor, from the math and computer science
   department no less, brought in sheets of paper and printed course catalogs
   and told us to make our schedules. That is something we would have done in
   the era before computers, but certainly not in this day and age. After five
   minutes of trying to put together a series of options, in case the classes
   I wanted were full, I decided that Trailhead was not an effective tool for
   making schedules. I exported the course data, loaded it into my own
   database, and wrote a quick script that would print a schedule given a list
   of CRNs. I told some people about it, and they wanted to use it too. I
   decided to make this website so that others would be able to graphically
   build and share their schedules, rather than having to deal with Trailhead.

   <dt>Is this website endorsed or hosted by CSM?</dt>
   <dd>No, this is my personal website. It does not interact with any CSM
   system.</dd>

   <dt>If this site is not run by CSM, where do you get your data?</dt>
   <dd>All schedule data made available trough this site is also publicly available <a href="https://banner.mines.edu/prod/owa/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched">here</a>.</dd>

   <dt>Can this website sign me up for classes?</dt>
   <dd>No. This website exists for the sole purpose of making the process of
   building schedules easier. You must still go to Trailhead and register, as
   normal. This website does not interact with any computer systems at CSM.</dd>

   <dt>How do I sign up for classes then?</dt>
   <dd>When viewing a schedule, the CRNs for the courses in the schedule are
   conveniently displayed at the top of the schedule and in the boxes to the
   right. Use these CRNs to sign up for courses in Trailhead. Be sure to
   verify your schedule in Trailhead after you have signed up for courses! The
   registrar often changes courses, and this website may not be immediately
   updated to reflect the latest course changes.</dd>

   <dt>How do I make a new schedule?</dt>
   <dd>Click on the create schedule link at the bottom of the
   <a href="[<$SM_ROOT>]/schedules">saved schedules</a> page.

   <dt>What is an active schedule?</dt>
   <dd>Your active schedule is the schedule that is modified when you click
   "add section" (or similar) when browsing or searching for course
   sections. Generally, you should set your active schedule to the schedule
   with which you are currently working. Further, only active schedules are
   searched when displaying which people are in a class or section.</dd>

   <dt>What does making a schedule public entail?</dt>
   <dd>Making your schedule public allows other people to look at your
   schedule, for example if you email the URL of your schedule to someone
   else. Others will not need to log in to see your schedule if it is public.
   Further, by marking your schedule public, it allows other users to see that
   you are in one of their classes, among other nice features. In addition, if
   your schedule is not marked public, then certain features will be disabled,
   such as the display of other people in your classes on the show schedule
   display.</dd>

   <dt>In the credit hours column, what is the number in parenthesis?</dt>
   <dd>If you have multiple sections of the same course in your schedule, for
   example if you are trying to decide which section you like best, the value
   in parenthesis is the number of credit hours in your schedule when each
   course is only counted once. This prevents double counting of courses. If
   you do not have the same course in your schedule multiple times, you will
   not see this value.</dd>

   <dt>Is there an advanced search feature?</dt>
   <dd>The search interface supports complex queries with boolean operators.
   Please see the <a href="[<$SM_ROOT>]/courses/search/help">search help</a> page.</dd>

   <dt>My question is not answered here.</dt>
   <dd>Please visit the <a href="[<$SM_ROOT>]/suggestions">suggestions page</a>.</dd>

   <dt>I have a suggestion to make the site better.</dt>
   <dd>Great! Please tell me about it on the <a href="[<$SM_ROOT>]/suggestions">suggestions page</a>.</dd>
