Installation instructions for the schedule miner.

1. Ensure the ADOdb Database Abstraction Library and the Smarty Template Engine
   are installed and in the PHP search path.

   supported at some point in the future.
3. Copy config.example.ini to config.ini, modifying the database settings
   as appropriate.
4. Copy .htaccess.example to .htaccess, modifying the filesystem location
   and website location as appropriate.
5. If using the search module, install and configure sphinx using the sample
   sphinx configuration file in config.
